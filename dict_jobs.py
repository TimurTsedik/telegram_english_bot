    and its associated Russian words in the e_r_words table.

    Parameters:

    e_word_id: The ID of the English word for which the links are to be found.
    Return Value:

    A tuple containing the ID of the English-Russian word link (e_r_word_id)
     and the ID of the associated Russian word (r_word_id).
    Database Query Explanation:

    Select Statement:
    Retrieves the ID of the English-Russian word link (e_r_word_id) and the
    ID of the associated Russian word (r_word_id).
    Filters the results based on the provided e_word_id to find the associations
    specific to that English word.
    Exception Handling:
    Catches any exceptions that might occur during the execution of the query.
    Prints detailed information about the exception for debugging purposes.
